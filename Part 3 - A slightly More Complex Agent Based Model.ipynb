    "# Part 3: A Slightly More Complex Agent Based Model \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Authors: Bill Thompson (biltho@mpi.nl) and Limor Raviv (limor.raviv@mpi.nl) \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this third tutorial, we will build a more complex simulation of agents using the commands in the second notebook, making our agents and their interactions a bit more ecologically valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major differences between these models are:\n",
    "1. Instead of having agents with simple binary representaions (either [a] or [i]), agents in this model will have a continuous distribution around their prefered vowel.\n",
    "2. The interactions in this model will be double-sided, so that both agents change their behavior after interacting.\n",
    "3. Agents' personalities will be less rigid, allowing for more interesting changes during interaction: stubborn agents will align a little bit (instead of not at all), while flexible agents will align to a greater extent (but not fully).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make multiple simulations of interactions under different conditions, and see how this affects the distribution of vowels in the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting up the network\n",
    "First, let's create lists containing the possible biases for our agents. In this more complex model, agents have a range of possible vowels they can produce, which is distributed normally around a mean value on a single dimension. In this example, a mean of \"-1\" will correspond to [a] and a mean of \"1\" will corresponf to [i]."
